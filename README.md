# P_4_4_Biodegradability
Classifying biodegradability of compounds using QSAR Data

## Motivation
The Goal of this project is to use QSAR-Data (Quantitative Structure Ability Relationship) from cemical Compounds and classify biodegradable and non biodegradable substances. Since compounds can last hundreds of years before being decomposed, degradability experiments will take time accordingly. This is where the approach of QSAR begins to shine. Just by looking at relatively quick to obtain molecular properties, the molecules behaviour (in this case biodegradability) can be estimated. Thus helping to ensure correct disposal of chemicals and saving the environment, while also reducing expensive longterm experiments.

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by UCI. And can be found here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation

## Explopratory Data Analysis (EDA)
For EDA the Dat is split into the two target classes "degradable" and non "degradable" in order to find features with significant differences between the two groups.
Some of the most relevant features being:

|Features provinding goo seperation |
