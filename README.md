# P_4_4_Biodegradability
Classifying biodegradability of compounds using QSAR Data

## Motivation
The Goal of this project is to use QSAR-Data from cemical Compounds and classify biodegradable and non biodegradable substances. Since compounds can last hundreds of years before being decomposed, degradability experiments will take time accordingly. This is where the approach of Quantitative Structure Ability Relationship begins to shine. Just by looking at relatively quick to obtain molecular properties, the molecules behaviour (in this case biodegradability) can be estimated. Thus helping to ensure correct disposal of chemicals and saving the environment, while also reducing expenseive longterm experiments.
